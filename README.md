##### A funny story

When I was a little kid I suffered some painful moments because of my dad!
This story takes place when I was around 5 or 6. We had moved into our new house a few years earlier and it was time to clean the ground around it so that we could build a paved way to access the house itself. We had to remove all the little rocks that were there at the time. It was quite tedious and we ended up throwing them around to go faster. Unwillingly, my father threw a significantly big rock on my head and I started bleeding heavily! My mother was not happy at all but fortunately we could solve this without having to go to the hospital.

###### TL;DR

My father threw a rock on my head when I was a kid.
